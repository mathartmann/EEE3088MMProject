This project concerns the creation of a micromouse. 

A micromouse is an electronic device created to navigate its own way to the centre of a maze that it
has never before been exposed to. This is achieved through several subsystems working in tandem.
These subsystems (in this project) include:
1. The power subsystem - Responsible for providing power to the motors, sensing subsystem and
the motherboard
2. The sensing subsystem - Responsible for the navigation through the maze through the use of
sensors
3. The motherboard - Responsible for connecting all other subsystems together and providing the
ability for programming the micromouse

This repository houses all relevant datasheets, pcb gerber files and reports related to both the sensing and power subsystems.
